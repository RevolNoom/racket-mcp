## Description

Implement `mcp/core/shared/stdio.rkt`, the **newline-delimited JSON framing** layer for `racket-mcp`. MCP's stdio transport frames each JSON-RPC message as one line of UTF-8 JSON terminated by a single `\n`; the receiver buffers a continuous byte stream (which arrives in arbitrary chunk boundaries) and re-assembles it into discrete messages. This module provides exactly that, in two halves:

1. **Encoder** — `serialize-message`: a JSON-RPC message envelope (a `jsexpr` JSON object) → **framed bytes** (`JSON.stringify(message) + '\n'`, UTF-8). Mirrors TS `serializeMessage`.
2. **Decoder / read buffer** — a `ReadBuffer` analogue that **buffers a byte stream** fed to it in arbitrary chunks and yields complete messages one at a time, **buffering partial frames** across reads. Mirrors TS `ReadBuffer` (`append` / `readMessage` / `clear`).

This module is the **direct transliteration of `stdio.ts`** — same framing, same default max-buffer size, same three load-bearing `ReadBuffer` behaviours (below). It is **NOT** a redesign; the queue is explicit that the three behaviours must be **mirrored and NOT "fixed."**

### Framing — the three `ReadBuffer` behaviours that MUST be mirrored (do NOT omit, do NOT "fix")

These three are PINNED by the queue as deliberate behaviours an implementer might wrongly "correct." Port each verbatim:

**(a) Max-buffer-size enforcement — a DoS guard that THROWS on overflow.** A configurable cap with default `STDIO-DEFAULT-MAX-BUFFER-SIZE = (* 10 1024 1024)` (10 MB). `append` computes `new-size = (+ current-length chunk-length)`; if `new-size > max` it **clears the buffer and raises** (`exn:fail?`). This is an intentional denial-of-service guard against an unbounded line with no newline — do **NOT** "fix" it to silently truncate, drop the chunk, or grow without bound. Two pinned sub-behaviours (from the TS fixtures):
- **`>` not `>=`** — a buffer filled to *exactly* `max` does **not** throw; only the append that would *exceed* `max` throws (TS test `should allow appending up to exactly the max size`).
- **clear-before-throw** — on overflow the buffer is cleared *before* the raise, so the buffer is **reusable** afterward (TS test `should clear buffer before throwing on overflow`: after the throw, a fresh `append` + `read` works normally).

**(b) CRLF tolerance — strip a trailing `\r` before parse.** A line may be `\r\n`-framed (e.g. a peer on Windows, or a tool that emits CRLF). Before parsing a line, strip a single trailing `\r` (byte `13`) if present (TS: `.replace(/\r$/, '')`). A `\r\n`-framed message MUST decode **identically** to its `\n`-framed form. Do **NOT** treat the `\r` as part of the JSON.

**(c) Skip non-JSON lines — continue, do NOT throw.** A line that fails to **parse as JSON** (e.g. `Debug: Starting server`, `Warning: …`, an unbalanced-brace fragment, an empty line) is **skipped** — `readMessage` continues to the next line rather than raising. This is intentional (hot-reload tools like `tsx`/`nodemon` write plain-text debug output to stdout interleaved with the protocol stream). Do **NOT** "correct" this to a hard error.
> **CRITICAL distinction — non-JSON-skip vs invalid-envelope-throw (PINNED).** Skipping applies ONLY when the line fails to **parse as JSON**. A line that **parses as valid JSON but is not a well-formed JSON-RPC message** (e.g. `{"not": "a jsonrpc message"}`) MUST **raise**, NOT be skipped — TS test `should still throw on valid JSON that fails schema validation`. The TS code distinguishes these by `error instanceof SyntaxError`: a `JSON.parse` `SyntaxError` → `continue` (skip); a schema-validation error → re-`throw`. The Racket port mirrors this exactly: a `read-json` parse failure (or an empty/whitespace-only line) → skip; a successfully parsed value that fails the JSON-RPC envelope check → raise. **Getting this distinction wrong (skipping the invalid-envelope case, or throwing on the non-JSON case) is the single most likely defect for this item.**

### The `deserializeMessage` analogue — what counts as a "message" (PINNED, read carefully)

TS `deserializeMessage(line)` = `JSONRPCMessageSchema.parse(JSON.parse(line))`. Two facts pin the Racket port:

1. **The frame payload is a `jsexpr` JSON-RPC envelope (a `json-object?`), NOT a method-dispatched MCP facade struct.** TS's `ReadBuffer` yields a `JSONRPCMessage` — the **shallow** JSON-RPC envelope (request / notification / response / error), validated structurally; it does **NOT** perform MCP-method-specific param parsing (that is the `Protocol` layer's job, after the message is routed). The Racket port mirrors this: `serialize-message` takes, and `read-message!` yields, the **`read-json`-shaped `jsexpr`** (a symbol-keyed immutable `hasheq` — the wire form). **Method-specific dispatch belongs to M7 / the protocol engine, which needs a *negotiated revision* (S1's `dispatch-for` is keyed by `(method . revision)`); the framing layer is revision-agnostic and never decides a revision.** This is the central framing decision — do NOT pull the S1 revision dispatch or facade `normalize-*` seam into M5e.

2. **The envelope validation reuses S1's `guards.rkt`.** S1 already ships the `JSONRPCMessageSchema.parse` analogue as three shallow structural predicates: `is-jsonrpc-request?`, `is-jsonrpc-notification?`, `is-jsonrpc-response?` (the last is itself `result-response ∨ error-response`). A parsed value is a valid JSON-RPC **message** iff it satisfies `(or (is-jsonrpc-request? v) (is-jsonrpc-notification? v) (is-jsonrpc-response? v))`. `deserialize-message` runs this check and **raises** when it fails (the invalid-envelope-throw of behaviour (c)). Do NOT re-implement the envelope rules — reuse the S1 guards (single source of truth; keeps M5e in parity with the rest of the core).

> **Whole-line parse (PINNED — match `JSON.parse(line)`).** TS `JSON.parse(line)` consumes the **entire** line as one JSON value; trailing non-whitespace makes it throw (→ skip). Racket `read-json` reads **one** value and stops, ignoring trailing bytes. To match TS, `deserialize-message` MUST parse the line as a *whole* JSON value: read one `jsexpr`, then confirm the remainder of the (CRLF-stripped) line is **whitespace-only / EOF**; if trailing non-whitespace remains, treat the line as **non-JSON** (skip, like a `SyntaxError`). This keeps `{...}garbage` a skipped line, not a half-accepted message. (The fixtures do not directly probe trailing garbage, but this is the faithful reading of `JSON.parse(line)`; pin it with one test — see Testing Strategy Part 4.)

> **Empty / whitespace-only line → skip (PINNED).** `read-json` on `""` or `"   "` returns `eof` (it skips leading whitespace and finds no value). An `eof` (no value) line is treated as **non-JSON → skip**, matching TS where `JSON.parse("")` throws `SyntaxError` → `continue` (TS test `should skip empty lines`: `\n\n{msg}\n\n` yields just the one message). Leading/trailing whitespace *around* a valid value is tolerated (`read-json` skips leading whitespace; the trailing-whitespace-only remainder passes the whole-line check) — TS test `should tolerate leading/trailing whitespace around valid JSON`.

### Public surface (PINNED)

```racket
;; --- encoder ---
(serialize-message msg)                 ; json-object? -> bytes?   ; JSON + "\n", UTF-8 framed bytes

;; --- decoder convenience (the deserializeMessage analogue) ---
(deserialize-message line)              ; (or/c bytes? string?) -> json-object?
                                        ;   parse one whole JSON value + envelope-validate;
                                        ;   RAISES on a valid-JSON-but-invalid-envelope line.
                                        ;   (Used internally by read-message! and exposed for symmetry/tests.)

;; --- read buffer (the ReadBuffer analogue) ---
(make-read-buffer [#:max-buffer-size STDIO-DEFAULT-MAX-BUFFER-SIZE])  ; -> read-buffer?
(read-buffer? v)                        ; -> boolean?
(read-buffer-append! rb chunk)          ; read-buffer? bytes? -> void  ; RAISES on overflow (clears first)
(read-buffer-read-message! rb)          ; read-buffer? -> (or/c json-object? #f)
                                        ;   #f when no COMPLETE frame is buffered yet (TS null);
                                        ;   skips non-JSON lines; RAISES on a complete invalid-envelope line.
(read-buffer-clear! rb)                 ; read-buffer? -> void

STDIO-DEFAULT-MAX-BUFFER-SIZE           ; = (* 10 1024 1024)  (10485760)
```

- **The "no complete message" return is `#f` (PINNED).** TS `readMessage` returns `null` when the buffer holds no newline-terminated line yet. The Racket analogue is **`#f`** (consistent with item 013's no-match → `#f` convention). A decoded message is always a `json-object?` (a hash), never `#f`, so the result is unambiguous: `#f` ⇔ "no complete frame available; feed more bytes." Pin with a test (`(read-buffer-read-message! (make-read-buffer))` → `#f` on a fresh buffer).
- **`append!` / `read-message!` / `clear!` are stateful (`!` suffix).** The `read-buffer` is a small mutable struct holding the accumulated bytes + the max-size cap. This faithfully mirrors TS's mutable `ReadBuffer` (the transport feeds it chunks as they arrive off the port). Use a `(struct read-buffer ([bytes #:mutable] max-size))` (or a boxed bytes field). The buffered bytes default to empty (`#""`); `clear!` resets to empty.
- **`append!` takes `bytes?` (PINNED).** The wire is bytes (TS `Buffer`); the transport reads raw bytes off the port and feeds them in. Do NOT make `append!` take a string (that would force a premature, possibly mid-multibyte-codepoint UTF-8 decode at a chunk boundary). Decoding to text happens **per line**, after a full newline-terminated line is isolated — so a multibyte character split across two chunks reassembles correctly at the byte level before any decode. `serialize-message` returns `bytes?` symmetrically.
- **Internal buffer representation (PINNED).** A mutable bytes field; `append!` sets it to `(bytes-append current chunk)` (or `chunk` when empty); `read-message!` scans for the first newline byte (`10`), and on a hit `subbytes` the line out (`[0, idx)`) and replaces the field with the remainder (`[idx+1, end)`). This mirrors TS's `Buffer.concat` + `subarray`. (O(n) concat like TS; M7 may optimize with a smarter accumulator later if a profile demands — out of scope here. Note it in Decisions.)

### Encoder details (PINNED)

`serialize-message msg`: `(bytes-append (string->bytes/utf-8 (jsexpr->string msg)) #"\n")`. Mirrors TS `JSON.stringify(message) + '\n'`. **Does NOT validate** the envelope (TS `serializeMessage` does not either — it trusts its caller, the `Protocol` layer, to hand it a well-formed message). Contract the input to `json-object?` so a non-object is caught at the boundary, but do not run the `is-jsonrpc-*` predicates here. The newline is a single `\n` (byte `10`), never `\r\n` — the encoder always emits the canonical `\n` framing; CRLF tolerance is a *receiver*-side accommodation only.

### Decoder details (PINNED — port `ReadBuffer.readMessage`)

`read-buffer-read-message! rb` loops:
1. If the buffer holds no `\n` (byte `10`) → return **`#f`** (incomplete frame; TS `return null`).
2. Else split off the bytes before the first `\n` as the candidate line; replace the buffer with the bytes after it.
3. **Strip a single trailing `\r`** (byte `13`) from the candidate line (CRLF tolerance, behaviour (b)).
4. Attempt `deserialize-message` on the line:
   - **Parse failure** (`read-json` raises, returns `eof`, or leaves trailing non-whitespace) → the line is **non-JSON**: **`continue`** the loop to the next line (behaviour (c) skip). Do NOT raise.
   - **Parse success but envelope-invalid** (`is-jsonrpc-*` all `#f`) → **raise** (behaviour (c) invalid-envelope-throw). Do NOT skip.
   - **Parse success and envelope-valid** → return the `json-object?`.
> **Distinguishing the two failure modes (PINNED implementation note).** Do NOT collapse both into one `with-handlers` that skips everything — that would wrongly skip the invalid-envelope case. Structure it as: (i) try to parse the line to a `jsexpr`, catching ONLY the parse/`read-json` exception (and the eof / trailing-garbage cases) → on parse failure, skip; (ii) on parse success, run the envelope check **outside** the parse handler → on envelope-invalid, raise. Mirror TS's `if (error instanceof SyntaxError) continue; else throw;` precisely. (A clean factoring: `try-parse-json-line` returns `(values jsexpr #t)` on a clean whole-value parse or `(values #f #f)` on any parse failure; `read-message!` then validates the envelope of a `#t` result and raises if invalid.)

### `append!` overflow details (PINNED — port `ReadBuffer.append`)

```racket
;; new-size = current-length + chunk-length; if new-size > max: clear THEN raise.
(define (read-buffer-append! rb chunk)
  (define new-size (+ (bytes-length (read-buffer-bytes rb)) (bytes-length chunk)))
  (when (> new-size (read-buffer-max-size rb))
    (read-buffer-clear! rb)                     ; clear BEFORE raising (reusable after)
    (error 'read-buffer-append! "ReadBuffer exceeded maximum size of ~a bytes"
           (read-buffer-max-size rb)))
  (set-read-buffer-bytes! rb (bytes-append (read-buffer-bytes rb) chunk)))
```
- `>` (strict) so exactly-`max` is allowed.
- clear-before-raise so the buffer is reusable.
- The raised error MUST be an `exn:fail?` whose message mentions the max size (so a test can assert it like TS's `/ReadBuffer exceeded maximum size/` regex). A plain `(error …)` suffices; an S1 error-layer constructor (`make-protocol-error`/`make-mcp-error`) is also acceptable if the implementer prefers consistency with item 013's raise-on-malformed style — either way it MUST be `exn:fail?` and carry the size in the message. (Decisions records which was shipped.)

### Imports + portability (PINNED)

- The module requires: `mcp/core/main.rkt` (the S1 barrel — the `is-jsonrpc-request?` / `is-jsonrpc-notification?` / `is-jsonrpc-response?` guards + `JSONRPC-VERSION` + the errors M2 if used for the raise) and `json` (`read-json` / `jsexpr->string` / `string->jsexpr`). The in-memory byte ports (`open-input-bytes`) and bytes ops (`bytes-append`, `subbytes`, `bytes-length`, the newline scan) are **`racket/base`**.
- **No subprocess, no socket, no real device I/O.** Although the queue frames M5e as "the only M5 module that performs I/O," the `ReadBuffer`/encoder are mechanically **pure byte manipulation** — the buffer never reads stdin or spawns a subprocess; the *transport (M7)* owns the actual port reads/writes and feeds bytes to this buffer. So this module pulls **no** `racket/system` / `racket/tcp` / `racket/udp` / `net/*` / subprocess / socket module — it stays portability-clean by construction. (`json` is a core, socket-free collection.)
> **Item 017 still ISOLATES this module from the S2 restricted-load sweep (PINNED — honor the queue's framing).** The queue + item 017 designate `shared/stdio.rkt` as "the only S2 module permitted to touch I/O" and have item 017's collection-wide restricted-namespace sweep **isolate** it (the non-I/O modules — `uri-template`/`tool-name-validation`/`metadata-utils`/`auth` — are swept; stdio is the carve-out). This item therefore does **NOT** add a per-module `module->imports` restricted-load test (consistent with items 014/015). It honors the no-subprocess/no-socket import discipline (and its actual closure happens to be clean), but the formal sweep + the isolation carve-out are item 017's job. Do not duplicate them here.

### Scope guards (explicit — do NOT cross these lines)

- **Mirror, do NOT "fix" the three behaviours.** Max-buffer overflow → THROW (not truncate); CRLF → strip trailing `\r` (not reject); non-JSON line → skip (not error). The invalid-*envelope* line still THROWS. These are PINNED by the queue.
- **No real device I/O / no transport.** This module is the framing buffer + codec ONLY. It does NOT read stdin, write stdout, spawn a subprocess, open a socket, or own a port loop — that is M7 (S6a), the consumer. Do NOT import `racket/system`, sockets, or `net/*`.
- **No method-specific MCP parsing / no revision dispatch.** The frame payload is the shallow `jsexpr` JSON-RPC envelope (validated via the S1 guards), NOT a `dispatch-for`/`normalize-*` facade struct. The framing layer is revision-agnostic. (M7/the engine routes + normalizes after framing.)
- **No re-implementation of the envelope rules.** Reuse S1's `is-jsonrpc-request?` / `is-jsonrpc-notification?` / `is-jsonrpc-response?`. Do not hand-roll a parallel JSON-RPC validator.
- **Encoder always emits `\n`.** Never `\r\n`. CRLF is receiver-side tolerance only.
- **No `(module+ test …)`** in `stdio.rkt` — tests live under `mcp/core/shared/test/` (consistent with items 010–015).
- **Explicit `provide`** — never `(all-defined-out)` (architecture §1.3). No internal helper (the line-scan, the parse helper) leaks.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `mcp/core/shared/stdio.rkt` exists as `#lang racket/base` with an explicit, curated `provide` (no `(provide (all-defined-out))`). It lives in the existing `mcp/core/shared/` collection (created by item 013).
- [ ] The module exports exactly: `serialize-message`, `deserialize-message`, `make-read-buffer`, `read-buffer?`, `read-buffer-append!`, `read-buffer-read-message!`, `read-buffer-clear!`, and `STDIO-DEFAULT-MAX-BUFFER-SIZE`. It does NOT leak internal line-scan / parse helpers.
- [ ] **`STDIO-DEFAULT-MAX-BUFFER-SIZE` constant.** `(= STDIO-DEFAULT-MAX-BUFFER-SIZE (* 10 1024 1024))` → `#t` (`10485760`), matching TS `STDIO_DEFAULT_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`.
- [ ] **Encoder framing.** `(serialize-message (hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'method "foobar"))` → a `bytes?` ending in a single `\n` (byte `10`); decoding it back (`(string->jsexpr (bytes->string/utf-8 (subbytes framed 0 (sub1 (bytes-length framed)))))`) reconstructs the message. The frame ends in `\n`, never `\r\n`.
- [ ] **Fresh buffer yields no message.** `(read-buffer-read-message! (make-read-buffer))` → `#f` (TS `should have no messages after initialization`).
- [ ] **Yield only after a newline (partial-frame buffering, core G1).** Appending `(serialize-message msg)` WITHOUT a trailing newline (i.e. the JSON bytes only) → `read-message!` returns `#f`; then appending `#"\n"` → `read-message!` returns the message, and a subsequent `read-message!` returns `#f`. (Ports `should only yield a message after a newline`.)
- [ ] **Multi-message round-trip in order (the queue headline).** Encode N (≥ 3) distinct messages, concatenate their framed bytes, `append!` the whole blob, then `read-message!` N times → the N messages come back **in order**, and the (N+1)th `read-message!` → `#f`. (Encode→feed→decode-all parity.)
- [ ] **Partial frame split across two reads reassembles.** Split one framed message's bytes at an arbitrary mid-frame offset; `append!` the first half → `read-message!` → `#f`; `append!` the second half (including the `\n`) → `read-message!` → the message. Also exercise a split that lands **inside a multibyte UTF-8 character** (e.g. a message whose value contains `"é"`/`"日本語"`, split between the two UTF-8 bytes of a codepoint) → the message still reassembles and decodes correctly (proves byte-level buffering, not premature per-chunk text decode). (Ports `should preserve incomplete JSON at end of buffer until completed`, extended for the multibyte-boundary case.)
- [ ] **Reusable after clear.** `append!` `#"foobar"` (garbage), `clear!`, `read-message!` → `#f`; then `append!` a valid framed message → `read-message!` → the message. (Ports `should be reusable after clearing`.)
- [ ] **Max-buffer overflow throws — default cap.** A `make-read-buffer` (default 10 MB) filled with 1 MB chunks up to 10 MB does NOT throw; the next 1 MB `append!` **raises** `exn:fail?` with a message matching `ReadBuffer exceeded maximum size`. (Ports `should throw when buffer exceeds default max size`.)
- [ ] **Max-buffer overflow throws — custom cap.** `(make-read-buffer #:max-buffer-size 100)`: `append!` 50 bytes (ok), then `append!` 51 bytes → **raises**. (Ports `should throw when buffer exceeds custom max size`.)
- [ ] **`>` not `>=` (exactly-at-max allowed).** `(make-read-buffer #:max-buffer-size 100)`: `append!` exactly 100 bytes → does **NOT** raise. (Ports `should allow appending up to exactly the max size`.)
- [ ] **Clear-before-throw (reusable after overflow).** `(make-read-buffer #:max-buffer-size 100)`: `append!` 50, then `append!` 51 → raises; afterward `append!` 50 again succeeds and `read-message!` → `#f` (buffer was cleared, not left poisoned). (Ports `should clear buffer before throwing on overflow`.)
- [ ] **CRLF tolerance — `\r\n` decodes identically to `\n`.** A message framed with `\r\n` (`(bytes-append (string->bytes/utf-8 (jsexpr->string msg)) #"\r\n")`) `append!`'d and read → the SAME `json-object?` as the `\n`-framed form (`check-equal?`). The trailing `\r` is stripped, not parsed. (Ports the CRLF accommodation.)
- [ ] **Skip empty lines.** `append!` `(bytes-append #"\n\n" (serialize-message msg) #"\n\n")` → `read-message!` → the message; next `read-message!` → `#f` (the empty lines are skipped, not errors). (Ports `should skip empty lines`.)
- [ ] **Skip non-JSON lines before a valid message.** `append!` `Debug: Starting server\nWarning: Something happened\n` + a framed message → `read-message!` → the message; next → `#f`. (Ports `should skip non-JSON lines before a valid message`.)
- [ ] **Skip non-JSON lines interleaved with multiple valid messages.** `Debug line 1\n` + frame(m1) + `Debug line 2\nAnother non-JSON line\n` + frame(m2) → `read-message!` → m1, → m2, → `#f`. (Ports `should skip non-JSON lines interleaved with multiple valid messages`.)
- [ ] **Skip unbalanced-brace / JSON-looking-but-invalid lines.** `{incomplete\nincomplete}\n` + frame(msg) → the msg (the two malformed lines skipped); and `{invalidJson: true}\n` (unquoted key, valid-looking but not JSON) + frame(msg) → the msg. (Ports `should skip lines with unbalanced braces` + `should skip lines that look like JSON but fail to parse`.)
- [ ] **Tolerate whitespace around valid JSON.** `append!` `(bytes-append #"  " (string->bytes/utf-8 (jsexpr->string msg)) #"  \n")` → `read-message!` → the message. (Ports `should tolerate leading/trailing whitespace around valid JSON`.)
- [ ] **Non-JSON-skip vs invalid-envelope-THROW distinction (CRITICAL).** A line that is **valid JSON but not a JSON-RPC message** raises, it is NOT skipped: `append!` `(bytes-append (string->bytes/utf-8 "{\"not\": \"a jsonrpc message\"}") #"\n")` → `read-message!` **raises** `exn:fail?`. (Ports `should still throw on valid JSON that fails schema validation`.) Contrast with the skip cases above (which do NOT raise).
- [ ] **`deserialize-message` validates the envelope.** `(deserialize-message "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"foobar\"}")` → `(hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'method "foobar")`; `(deserialize-message #"{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"result\":{}}")` → the result-response envelope; `(check-exn exn:fail? (λ () (deserialize-message "{\"not\":\"a message\"}")))`; `(check-exn exn:fail? (λ () (deserialize-message "42")))` (valid JSON, not an envelope). Accepts both `string?` and `bytes?` input.
- [ ] **All three envelope kinds round-trip.** A request (`(hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'id 1 'method "ping")`), a notification (`(hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'method "foobar")`), and a response (`(hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'id 1 'result (hasheq))`) each survive `serialize-message` → buffer → `read-message!` → `check-equal?` to the original. (Proves the guard union accepts request/notification/response.)
- [ ] **Imports = S1 only (+ `json`).** The module requires only `mcp/core/main.rkt` + `json` (+ `racket/base`). It requires NO transport/engine/role module, NO `racket/system`/subprocess, NO socket, NO `net/*`. (The transitive restricted-load proof — with stdio carved out as the I/O module — is item 017's collection-wide sweep; not duplicated here.)
- [ ] **No `(module+ test …)`** in `stdio.rkt` — tests live in `mcp/core/shared/test/stdio-test.rkt`.
- [ ] `raco make mcp/core/shared/stdio.rkt` exits 0 (compiles clean, no warnings).
- [ ] `raco test mcp/core/shared/` passes (exit 0) — the new module + test compile and run cleanly alongside the existing `uri-template` (013), `tool-name-validation` (014), `metadata-utils` + `auth` (015) suites. Sibling suites `raco test mcp/core/validators/` and `raco test mcp/core/util/` remain green (this item touches neither).
- [ ] **Progress** (`docs/aide/progress.md`): flip the `mcp/core/shared/stdio.rkt` (M5e) Stage-S2 deliverable line (📋 → 🚧 → ✅) AND check the Stage-S2 acceptance box `[ ] stdio framing (M5e) round-trips multi-message + partial-frame buffering, standalone` (this item owns it). The parity-matrix rows + the catch-all `raco test over all S2 modules` / demo boxes belong to items 017/018 — do NOT check those here (see Completion Reminder).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Re-read the references** for shape + behaviour:
   - `typescript-sdk/packages/core/src/shared/stdio.ts` — the `ReadBuffer` (`append` overflow-clear-throw with `>` ; `readMessage` newline-scan + `\r`-strip + `try { deserialize } catch (SyntaxError → continue; else throw)`; `clear`), `STDIO_DEFAULT_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`, `serializeMessage` (`JSON.stringify + '\n'`), `deserializeMessage` (`JSONRPCMessageSchema.parse(JSON.parse(line))`).
   - `typescript-sdk/packages/core/test/shared/stdio.test.ts` — every fixture (enumerate the groups: init/null, yield-after-newline, reusable-after-clear, `non-JSON line filtering` (empty / before-valid / interleaved / incomplete-preserved / unbalanced / looks-like-JSON / whitespace / still-throw-on-schema-fail), `buffer size limit` (default / custom / clear-before-throw / exactly-max / no-options)).
   - `mcp/core/types/guards.rkt` — `is-jsonrpc-request?` / `is-jsonrpc-notification?` / `is-jsonrpc-response?` (the envelope predicates the decoder reuses), and the doc note that a `read-json` object is a symbol-keyed immutable `hasheq` (so the test fixtures use `(hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" …)`).
   - `mcp/core/types/constants.rkt` — `JSONRPC-VERSION` = `"2.0"`.
2. **The design decisions are PINNED** (do not re-decide): message = shallow `jsexpr` envelope validated by the S1 guards (no revision dispatch / no facade struct); `read-buffer` is a mutable struct; `read-message!` → `#f` on incomplete; `append!` takes bytes, overflow → clear-then-raise with `>`; CRLF strip trailing `\r`; non-JSON line → skip, invalid-envelope line → raise; encoder always `\n`; imports S1 + `json` only.
3. **Write `mcp/core/shared/stdio.rkt`** (`#lang racket/base`):
   - `(require json "../main.rkt")` (relative S1 barrel — matching the `util/schema.rkt` / item-015 convention; `mcp/core/main.rkt` is not a registered collection path). NO `racket/system`, NO sockets, NO `net/*`.
   - A module-level **doc block** recording: the transliteration framing (port of TS `stdio.ts`); the three load-bearing behaviours (overflow-throw / CRLF-strip / non-JSON-skip) and the **non-JSON-skip-vs-invalid-envelope-throw distinction**; that the frame payload is the **shallow `jsexpr` envelope** validated via the S1 guards (revision-agnostic; method dispatch is M7's job); the `#f`-on-incomplete convention; that the buffer is pure byte manipulation (no real device I/O — M7 owns the port loop) and the orphaned-until-S6a note.
   - `STDIO-DEFAULT-MAX-BUFFER-SIZE` = `(* 10 1024 1024)`.
   - `serialize-message` (`(bytes-append (string->bytes/utf-8 (jsexpr->string msg)) #"\n")`; input contracted to `json-object?`; no envelope validation).
   - An internal **`jsonrpc-message?`** helper = `(or (is-jsonrpc-request? v) (is-jsonrpc-notification? v) (is-jsonrpc-response? v))` (NOT provided).
   - An internal **`try-parse-json-line`** (line bytes → `(values jsexpr #t)` on a clean whole-value parse, `(values #f #f)` on parse failure / eof / trailing-garbage). Use `(open-input-bytes line)` + `read-json`; on the `read-json` value, peek/read the remainder and confirm whitespace-only/eof; wrap `read-json` in a handler catching its read exn.
   - `deserialize-message` (accept `bytes?` or `string?`; CRLF-strip not needed here since callers pass a single line, but be liberal — strip a trailing `\r` defensively; parse via `try-parse-json-line`; on parse failure raise a parse error; on success, envelope-check and **raise** if invalid; return the `json-object?`).
   - `(struct read-buffer ([bytes #:mutable] max-size))`; `make-read-buffer` (keyword `#:max-buffer-size`, default the constant; initial bytes `#""`); `read-buffer-clear!` (set bytes to `#""`).
   - `read-buffer-append!` (overflow guard `>`, clear-then-raise; else `bytes-append`).
   - `read-buffer-read-message!` (loop: find byte `10`; none → `#f`; else split, strip trailing `13`, `try-parse-json-line` → parse-fail → continue (skip); parse-success → envelope-check → invalid → raise, valid → return). **The two failure modes MUST stay distinct** (skip parse failures; raise envelope failures) — mirror TS's `instanceof SyntaxError` branch.
   - Explicit `(provide …)` block (the eight names above).
4. **Write the test** `mcp/core/shared/test/stdio-test.rkt` (see Testing Strategy). Port EVERY `stdio.test.ts` fixture 1:1, plus the multi-message-round-trip + multibyte-split + all-three-envelope-kinds + `deserialize-message` direct cases.
5. **Run** `raco make mcp/core/shared/stdio.rkt` then `raco test mcp/core/shared/`. Fix any failure. Confirm `raco test mcp/core/validators/` and `raco test mcp/core/util/` still pass (this item touches neither).
6. **Update progress** (see Completion Reminder).

## Testing Strategy

The test is a **fixture-port + framing-round-trip harness**: it ports each `stdio.test.ts` fixture 1:1, asserting the SAME behaviour the TS suite asserts (G1 parity), plus the queue-mandated multi-message round-trip and partial-frame buffering, the multibyte-boundary split, the all-three-envelope-kinds round-trip, and direct `deserialize-message` cases. No external services; `raco test` only; the byte stream is **synthetic** (constructed in-test), so no real stdio/subprocess is needed.

**Test file:** `mcp/core/shared/test/stdio-test.rkt` (`#lang racket/base`; `(require rackunit json (file "../stdio.rkt"))`). `json` for building wire hashes / decoding framed bytes in assertions. No transport, no subprocess.

Small helpers keep assertions terse:
```racket
(define m  (hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'method "foobar"))           ; the TS testMessage (a notification)
(define (feed rb . chunks) (for ([c chunks]) (read-buffer-append! rb c)) rb)
;; (drain rb) -> list of all complete messages currently buffered, in order.
(define (drain rb)
  (let loop ([acc '()])
    (define msg (read-buffer-read-message! rb))
    (if msg (loop (cons msg acc)) (reverse acc))))
```

### Part 1 — Encoder + `deserialize-message`

- `(check-equal? STDIO-DEFAULT-MAX-BUFFER-SIZE (* 10 1024 1024))`.
- **Framing:** `(define framed (serialize-message m))` → `(check-true (bytes? framed))`; `(check-equal? (bytes-ref framed (sub1 (bytes-length framed))) 10)` (ends in `\n`); `(check-not-equal? (bytes-ref framed (- (bytes-length framed) 2)) 13)` (NOT `\r\n`); decoding the body (`(string->jsexpr (bytes->string/utf-8 (subbytes framed 0 (sub1 (bytes-length framed)))))`) `check-equal?`s `m`.
- **`deserialize-message` valid:** `(check-equal? (deserialize-message "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"foobar\"}") m)`; bytes input `(check-equal? (deserialize-message #"{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"result\":{}}") (hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'id 1 'result (hasheq)))`.
- **`deserialize-message` invalid-envelope raises:** `(check-exn exn:fail? (λ () (deserialize-message "{\"not\":\"a message\"}")))`; `(check-exn exn:fail? (λ () (deserialize-message "42")))` (valid JSON, not an envelope); `(check-exn exn:fail? (λ () (deserialize-message "[1,2,3]")))` (array, not an envelope).

### Part 2 — Read buffer: init, yield-after-newline, reuse (ported)

- **Init → `#f`:** `(check-false (read-buffer-read-message! (make-read-buffer)))` (`should have no messages after initialization`).
- **Yield only after newline:** build `rb`; `append!` `(string->bytes/utf-8 (jsexpr->string m))` (no newline) → `(check-false (read-buffer-read-message! rb))`; `append!` `#"\n"` → `(check-equal? (read-buffer-read-message! rb) m)`; `(check-false (read-buffer-read-message! rb))`. (`should only yield a message after a newline`.)
- **Reusable after clear:** `append!` `#"foobar"`; `clear!`; `(check-false (read-buffer-read-message! rb))`; `append!` `(serialize-message m)`; `(check-equal? (read-buffer-read-message! rb) m)`. (`should be reusable after clearing`.)

### Part 3 — Multi-message round-trip + partial-frame buffering (the queue headline)

- **Multi-message in order:** `(define m1 (hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'method "method1"))` … `m2` … `m3` (and/or a request + response); `(define blob (apply bytes-append (map serialize-message (list m1 m2 m3))))`; `(define rb (feed (make-read-buffer) blob))`; `(check-equal? (drain rb) (list m1 m2 m3))`; `(check-false (read-buffer-read-message! rb))`.
- **Partial frame split across two reads:** `(define f (serialize-message m1))`; pick a mid-frame split `k` (e.g. `(quotient (bytes-length f) 2)`); `(define rb (make-read-buffer))`; `append!` `(subbytes f 0 k)` → `(check-false (read-buffer-read-message! rb))`; `append!` `(subbytes f k)` → `(check-equal? (read-buffer-read-message! rb) m1)`. (`should preserve incomplete JSON at end of buffer until completed`.)
- **Split INSIDE a multibyte UTF-8 char:** `(define mu (hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'method "x" 'params (hasheq 'v "é日本語")))`; `(define f (serialize-message mu))`; find a split offset that lands between the two UTF-8 bytes of `é` (e.g. locate the `0xC3` byte and split right after it) — or more simply split at several byte offsets in a loop and assert each reassembles; `append!` the two halves → `(check-equal? (read-buffer-read-message! rb) mu)`. (Proves byte-level buffering: a naive per-chunk `bytes->string/utf-8` would corrupt the split codepoint; the byte buffer + per-complete-line decode does not.)

### Part 4 — Non-JSON line filtering (ported, the behaviour-(c) suite)

Each builds a buffer, feeds a blob, and asserts the surviving message(s) + a trailing `#f`:
- **Empty lines:** `(feed rb (bytes-append #"\n\n" (serialize-message m) #"\n\n"))` → `(check-equal? (drain rb) (list m))`. (`should skip empty lines`.)
- **Non-JSON before valid:** `(feed rb (bytes-append #"Debug: Starting server\n" #"Warning: Something happened\n" (serialize-message m)))` → `(check-equal? (drain rb) (list m))`. (`should skip non-JSON lines before a valid message`.)
- **Interleaved with multiple valid:** `(feed rb (bytes-append #"Debug line 1\n" (serialize-message m1) #"Debug line 2\n" #"Another non-JSON line\n" (serialize-message m2)))` → `(check-equal? (drain rb) (list m1 m2))`. (`should skip non-JSON lines interleaved with multiple valid messages`.)
- **Unbalanced braces:** `(feed rb (bytes-append #"{incomplete\n" #"incomplete}\n" (serialize-message m)))` → `(check-equal? (drain rb) (list m))`. (`should skip lines with unbalanced braces`.)
- **Looks-like-JSON-but-invalid:** `(feed rb (bytes-append #"{invalidJson: true}\n" (serialize-message m)))` → `(check-equal? (drain rb) (list m))`. (`should skip lines that look like JSON but fail to parse`.)
- **Whitespace around valid JSON:** `(feed rb (bytes-append #"  " (string->bytes/utf-8 (jsexpr->string m)) #"  \n"))` → `(check-equal? (read-buffer-read-message! rb) m)`. (`should tolerate leading/trailing whitespace around valid JSON`.)
- **Whole-line parse / trailing garbage (the PINNED `JSON.parse(line)` semantics):** `(feed rb (bytes-append (string->bytes/utf-8 (jsexpr->string m)) #"garbage\n" (serialize-message m1)))` → the trailing-garbage line is treated as non-JSON (skipped); `(check-equal? (drain rb) (list m1))`. (Pins that a value with trailing non-whitespace is rejected like TS `JSON.parse`, not half-accepted.)
- **CRITICAL — valid-JSON-but-invalid-envelope RAISES (not skip):** `(feed rb (bytes-append (string->bytes/utf-8 "{\"not\": \"a jsonrpc message\"}") #"\n"))`; `(check-exn exn:fail? (λ () (read-buffer-read-message! rb)))`. (`should still throw on valid JSON that fails schema validation`.) Contrast asserted directly against the skip cases above.

### Part 5 — CRLF tolerance

- `(define crlf (bytes-append (string->bytes/utf-8 (jsexpr->string m)) #"\r\n"))`; `(define rb (feed (make-read-buffer) crlf))`; `(check-equal? (read-buffer-read-message! rb) m)` — IDENTICAL to the `\n`-framed decode (the trailing `\r` is stripped). Also a multi-message CRLF blob: two `\r\n`-framed messages → `(drain rb)` → both.

### Part 6 — Buffer size limit (ported)

- **Default cap overflow:** `(define rb (make-read-buffer))`; `(define chunk (make-bytes (* 1024 1024) 0))` (1 MB of zero bytes); loop `(quotient STDIO-DEFAULT-MAX-BUFFER-SIZE (bytes-length chunk))` = 10 times `(read-buffer-append! rb chunk)` (no raise); `(check-exn exn:fail? (λ () (read-buffer-append! rb chunk)))`, and assert the message mentions the cap: `(check-exn #rx"ReadBuffer exceeded maximum size" (λ () (read-buffer-append! rb chunk)))` (on a fresh near-full buffer). (`should throw when buffer exceeds default max size`.) **Note:** the zero-byte chunk never contains a newline (`10`), so the buffer cannot drain — this faithfully drives the overflow.
- **Custom cap overflow:** `(define rb (make-read-buffer #:max-buffer-size 100))`; `(read-buffer-append! rb (make-bytes 50 0))` (ok); `(check-exn exn:fail? (λ () (read-buffer-append! rb (make-bytes 51 0))))`. (`should throw when buffer exceeds custom max size`.)
- **`>` not `>=` — exactly-at-max allowed:** `(check-not-exn (λ () (read-buffer-append! (make-read-buffer #:max-buffer-size 100) (make-bytes 100 0))))`. (`should allow appending up to exactly the max size`.)
- **Clear-before-throw (reusable):** `(define rb (make-read-buffer #:max-buffer-size 100))`; `(read-buffer-append! rb (make-bytes 50 0))`; `(check-exn exn:fail? (λ () (read-buffer-append! rb (make-bytes 51 0))))`; THEN `(check-not-exn (λ () (read-buffer-append! rb (make-bytes 50 0))))`; `(check-false (read-buffer-read-message! rb))` (buffer was cleared on the throw, so it holds only the post-throw 50 zero-bytes with no newline). (`should clear buffer before throwing on overflow`.)
- **No-options backwards-compat:** `(define rb (make-read-buffer))`; `(read-buffer-append! rb (serialize-message (hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'method "ping")))`; `(check-not-false (read-buffer-read-message! rb))`. (`should work with no options`.)

### Part 7 — All three envelope kinds round-trip

- **Request:** `(define req (hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'id 1 'method "ping"))`; serialize→buffer→read→`check-equal?`.
- **Notification:** `m` (above) → round-trips.
- **Result response:** `(define res (hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'id 1 'result (hasheq)))` → round-trips.
- **Error response:** `(define err (hasheq 'jsonrpc "2.0" 'id 1 'error (hasheq 'code -32600 'message "bad")))` → round-trips. (Proves the guard union accepts request / notification / result-response / error-response.)

### Fixture → ported-test mapping (1:1, the G1 contract)

| `should be reusable after clearing` | Part 2 |

### Fixture provenance

- The framing, max-buffer, CRLF, and non-JSON-skip behaviours + the still-throw-on-schema-fail case are lifted from `typescript-sdk/packages/core/test/shared/stdio.test.ts` (transcribed into Racket assertions; the Racket test does NOT parse the `.ts` at runtime). The multi-message-round-trip, multibyte-split, all-three-envelope-kinds, and trailing-garbage cases are net-new Racket assertions covering the queue's testable bullets + the `read-json`-vs-`JSON.parse` whole-line difference (record this in the test header).

---

## Dependencies

- **Upstream work items:**
  - **Stage S1 items 001–009** (✅ complete) — `mcp/core/main.rkt` (item 008 barrel) re-exports the `guards.rkt` envelope predicates `is-jsonrpc-request?` / `is-jsonrpc-notification?` / `is-jsonrpc-response?` (item 002) used by `deserialize-message`, plus `JSONRPC-VERSION` (item 001) and the errors M2 (items 006/007) if the overflow raise uses the S1 error layer. This is the ONLY project dependency.
  - **Item 013** created the `mcp/core/shared/` + `mcp/core/shared/test/` collection directories, into which this module + its test are added.
- **Downstream consumers (informational):**
  - **S6a stdio transport (`mcp/transport/stdio.rkt`, M7)** — M5e's **first real consumer**: M7 owns the `subprocess` + the stdin/stdout port loop, reads raw bytes off the port, `read-buffer-append!`s them, drains `read-buffer-read-message!` until `#f`, and `serialize-message`s outbound messages to the port. **This module has NO consumer inside S2** — it is built ahead of its S6a consumer (built now for L0 cohesion; ships fully tested standalone against a synthetic byte stream; integration coverage — partial/multi-message reads over a real subprocess, cross-SDK stdio parity — arrives with M7 in S6a).
  - **Item 017** — the S2 collection-wide restricted-load portability sweep **isolates** `shared/stdio.rkt` as the one I/O-permitted module (the non-I/O `shared/*` utils are swept). This item does NOT add a per-module sweep.
  - **Item 018** — the S2 demo encodes/decodes a stdio frame buffer (round-trips messages through `serialize-message` + a `read-buffer`), printing the recovered messages.
- **Tooling/runtime:** Racket ≥ 8.x (`raco`, `rackunit`, the core `json` collection). The `typescript-sdk/` checkout MUST be present for **authoring** — the behaviour is lifted from `shared/stdio.ts` and the fixtures from `test/shared/stdio.test.ts`. The Racket test does NOT parse the `.ts` at runtime (fixtures transcribed into Racket assertions), so a missing checkout would not break the running test but would make the fixture-port un-reproducible.

## Decisions & Trade-offs

To be updated during implementation.

The **design decisions below are PINNED at spec time** (real choices, not options). The **post-build outcome** (require list as built, exact check count, the overflow-error mechanism shipped) is *to be updated during implementation*.

**(a) The frame payload is the shallow `jsexpr` JSON-RPC envelope, validated by the S1 guards — NOT a method-dispatched facade struct.** TS `ReadBuffer` yields a `JSONRPCMessage` (the shallow envelope), not an MCP-method-parsed result; method dispatch needs a *negotiated revision* and belongs to M7 / the protocol engine. `serialize-message` takes, and `read-message!` yields, the `read-json`-shaped symbol-keyed `hasheq`. `deserialize-message` reuses `is-jsonrpc-request?` / `is-jsonrpc-notification?` / `is-jsonrpc-response?` (the `JSONRPCMessageSchema.parse` analogue) rather than re-implementing the envelope rules. **To be updated during implementation.**

**(b) `read-message!` → `#f` on an incomplete frame (TS `null`); a complete message is always a `json-object?`, so `#f` is unambiguous.** Consistent with item 013's no-match → `#f`. The buffer/append/clear are a small mutable struct (`!`-suffixed ops), faithfully mirroring TS's mutable `ReadBuffer`. **To be updated during implementation.**

**(c) The three queue-pinned behaviours are mirrored verbatim, NOT "fixed."** Max-buffer overflow → clear-then-THROW (`>` strict, so exactly-max is allowed; reusable after); CRLF → strip a single trailing `\r` before parse; non-JSON line → skip (continue). **The CRITICAL distinction:** a valid-JSON-but-invalid-*envelope* line still THROWS (mirrors TS's `instanceof SyntaxError ? continue : throw`). Getting the skip-vs-throw split wrong is the most likely defect; it is pinned with explicit contrasting tests. **To be updated during implementation.**

**(d) `append!` takes bytes; the buffer is byte-level; decode happens per complete line.** The wire is bytes (TS `Buffer`); decoding to text per-chunk would corrupt a multibyte UTF-8 codepoint split across a chunk boundary. Byte-level buffering + per-complete-line `read-json` avoids this (pinned with a multibyte-split test). The encoder emits canonical `\n` framing (never `\r\n`); CRLF is receiver-side tolerance only. **To be updated during implementation.**

**(e) Whole-line parse to match `JSON.parse(line)`.** Racket `read-json` reads one value and ignores trailing bytes; TS `JSON.parse(line)` rejects trailing non-whitespace. `deserialize-message` reads one value then confirms the remainder is whitespace-only/EOF, else treats the line as non-JSON (skip). Empty/whitespace-only lines (`read-json` → `eof`) are likewise non-JSON → skip. **To be updated during implementation.**

**(f) Pure byte manipulation — no real device I/O — despite the queue's "only M5 module that performs I/O" framing.** The `ReadBuffer`/codec never read stdin, write stdout, spawn a subprocess, or open a socket — the *transport (M7)* owns the port loop and feeds bytes in. So the actual import closure is `json` + S1 + `racket/base` byte ports — no `racket/system`/socket/`net/*`. Item 017 still *isolates* this module as the designated I/O carve-out per the queue; this item honors the no-subprocess/no-socket discipline but defers the formal sweep + isolation to 017 (no per-module walk here, consistent with items 014/015). **To be updated during implementation.**

**(g) Overflow-error mechanism.** The overflow raise is an `exn:fail?` whose message mentions the max size (so a test can assert `#rx"ReadBuffer exceeded maximum size"` like TS's regex). Either a plain `(error …)` or an S1 error-layer constructor (`make-protocol-error`/`make-mcp-error`) is acceptable; **record which shipped** (and whether the invalid-envelope raise uses the same mechanism). **To be updated during implementation.**

**(h) No `(module+ test …)` in `stdio.rkt`** — tests live in `test/stdio-test.rkt` (consistent with items 010–015; keeps the test-only `rackunit` require out of the module's closure).

**(i) Post-build outcomes (recorded at implementation).**
- **Require list as built:** [e.g. `(require json "../main.rkt")` — S1 + `json`; NO `net/*`/subprocess/socket. Note any `(only-in …)` narrowing.]
- **Exact check count:** `raco test mcp/core/shared/` → [N checks pass, 0 failures, 0 errors] (the new `stdio-test.rkt` suite added to items 013–015's [prior count]). Sibling suites: `raco test mcp/core/validators/` → [300]; `raco test mcp/core/util/` → [102].
- **`raco make`:** `raco make mcp/core/shared/stdio.rkt` → [exit 0, clean].
- **Overflow-error mechanism shipped:** [plain `error` | S1 `make-protocol-error` | …]; message form: [the `~a`-formatted size string].
- **Frame payload form:** [shallow `jsexpr` envelope via S1 guards — confirmed; no revision dispatch pulled in].
- **No `(module+ test …)`** in `stdio.rkt` (confirmed by grep); tests in `test/stdio-test.rkt`.

## Project-Specific Adaptations (Racket / raco / rackunit)

This is a **Racket library, not a service** — same adaptation pattern as items 010–015. The generic "Testing Prerequisites" template (Required Services / database / API endpoint / ports / health checks) does **not** apply and is adapted as follows (documented explicitly per the create-item skill):

- **Required Services → None.** Pure Racket library; no external services, databases, message queues, HTTP servers, sockets, subprocesses, or network. The `ReadBuffer`/codec are byte manipulation over **in-memory** bytes — the synthetic byte stream in the test is constructed in-process; **no real stdio / subprocess is touched.** (M7 in S6a is the module that performs real device I/O; M5e is its pure framing helper.)
- **Database / API endpoint / ports sections → N/A.** Removed; replaced by the Racket toolchain row below.
- **Required toolchain:** Racket ≥ 8.x (`raco test`, `rackunit`, the core `json` collection). (This env: Racket v8.18 [cs], per items 013–015.)
- **TS checkout role:** present at `typescript-sdk/`; **required for authoring** (behaviour from `shared/stdio.ts`; fixtures from `test/shared/stdio.test.ts`, transcribed into Racket assertions). Not parsed at test runtime.
- **Manual Validation Checklist → specialized** to `raco make` / `raco test` + a REPL encode/decode smoke check (below). No "service started" / "health check" / "screenshots" rows — replaced with N/A or removed.
- **Language/naming:** `#lang racket/base`; kebab-case bindings; `!`-suffixed stateful ops (`append!`/`read-message!`/`clear!`); explicit `(provide …)` never `all-defined-out` (architecture §1.3); S1+`json`-only imports, no `net/*`/subprocess/socket (architecture §4.1 portability).
- **Collection directory:** `mcp/core/shared/` + `mcp/core/shared/test/` already exist (item 013). This item adds `stdio.rkt` + `test/stdio-test.rkt`.
- **No-consumer-in-S2 note:** like items 013–015, this module has NO S2 consumer; it ships fully tested standalone (against a synthetic byte stream) and is wired up by M7 in S6a. The S2 demo (item 018) exercises it.

## Testing Prerequisites (CRITICAL)

### Required Services

**None (pure Racket library; no external services).** No databases, message queues, HTTP servers, sockets, subprocesses, or network dependencies. No real device I/O whatsoever — the buffer manipulates in-memory bytes; the test's byte stream is synthetic. The TS checkout is a **parity reference** read while authoring, not a runtime dependency.

| "Service" | Why | How to obtain | Port |
|---|---|---|---|
| Racket ≥ 8.x runtime | compile + run module and tests (`raco`, `rackunit`, core `json`) | system install (`racket --version` ≥ 8.0; this env: v8.18) | n/a |
| S1 barrel (`mcp/core/main.rkt`) | the module requires the S1 envelope guards (`is-jsonrpc-request?` etc.) + `JSONRPC-VERSION` | already present (items 001–008, ✅) | n/a |
| `typescript-sdk/` checkout | read while authoring to lift behaviour from `shared/stdio.ts` and the fixtures from `test/shared/stdio.test.ts` (G1 fixture parity) | already present at repo root | n/a |

### Environment Configuration

- **Environment variables / secrets / config files / free ports:** none required.
- **Racket version:** ≥ 8.x (verified for items 013–015: v8.18 [cs]).
- **Working directory:** run `raco test` from the **repo root** so the `mcp/...` collection path resolves.
- **How to run the tests:**
  - `raco make mcp/core/shared/stdio.rkt` — compile the stdio module clean.
  - `raco test mcp/core/shared/` — run all shared-collection tests (picks up `test/stdio-test.rkt` recursively), exit 0.
- **Pre-flight checks:**
  - `racket --version` → ≥ 8.0.
  - `raco test mcp/core/shared/` (pre-change) → green (items 013–015's checks pass) so the baseline is known.

### Manual Validation Checklist

*(Not yet built — leave UNCHECKED until implementation completes.)*

- [ ] **Build/compile succeeds:** `raco make mcp/core/shared/stdio.rkt` compiles with no errors/warnings.
- [ ] **Module loads in isolation:** `racket -e '(require (file "mcp/core/shared/stdio.rkt"))'` from repo root succeeds.
- [ ] **Tests pass:** `raco test mcp/core/shared/test/stdio-test.rkt` → all checks pass, exit 0.
- [ ] **Collection tests pass:** `raco test mcp/core/shared/` → exit 0 (new + existing 013–015 suites).
- [ ] **M3/M4 untouched:** `raco test mcp/core/validators/` AND `raco test mcp/core/util/` → still exit 0 (this item modifies neither).
- [ ] **Services started:** N/A (no services — pure library, no real device I/O).
- [ ] **Application runs:** N/A (library; "running" = the require + REPL encode/decode smoke check below).
- [ ] **Feature verified (REPL encode/decode smoke check):** from repo root, encode a message and read it back through a buffer — e.g.
      `racket -e '(require (file "mcp/core/shared/stdio.rkt")) (define rb (make-read-buffer)) (read-buffer-append! rb (serialize-message (hasheq (quote jsonrpc) "2.0" (quote method) "foobar"))) (read-buffer-read-message! rb)'`
      prints `'#hasheq((jsonrpc . "2.0") (method . "foobar"))` (encode frames it, the buffer recovers it). (Record exact transcript in Validation Results.)
- [ ] **`STDIO-DEFAULT-MAX-BUFFER-SIZE` verified:** `= (* 10 1024 1024)` = `10485760`.
- [ ] **Encoder framing verified:** `serialize-message` ends in a single `\n` (byte 10), not `\r\n`; decoding the body recovers the message.
- [ ] **Fresh buffer → `#f` verified;** yield-only-after-newline verified (no newline → `#f`; add `\n` → message → `#f`).
- [ ] **Multi-message round-trip verified:** N≥3 framed messages concatenated → drained in order → trailing `#f`.
- [ ] **Partial-frame buffering verified:** mid-frame split across two appends reassembles; a split INSIDE a multibyte UTF-8 char still reassembles + decodes.
- [ ] **Reusable-after-clear verified:** garbage + `clear!` → `#f`; then valid frame → message.
- [ ] **Max-buffer overflow verified:** default 10 MB cap throws on the over-cap append (message matches `ReadBuffer exceeded maximum size`); custom-100 cap throws on 51-over-50; **`>` not `>=`** (exactly 100 → no throw); clear-before-throw (reusable after overflow); no-options small append works.
- [ ] **CRLF tolerance verified:** a `\r\n`-framed message decodes `check-equal?` to its `\n`-framed form.
- [ ] **Non-JSON-skip verified:** empty lines, debug/warning lines, unbalanced braces, looks-like-JSON-but-invalid, surrounding whitespace — all skipped; surrounding valid frames still decode.
- [ ] **Trailing-garbage (whole-line parse) verified:** `{json}garbage\n` skipped (not half-accepted).
- [ ] **CRITICAL — invalid-envelope THROW verified:** `{"not":"a jsonrpc message"}\n` → `read-message!` raises (NOT skipped); contrasted against the skip cases.
- [ ] **`deserialize-message` verified:** valid request/notification/response → the envelope; `{"not":"a message"}` / `42` / `[1,2,3]` → raise; accepts string AND bytes input.
- [ ] **All three envelope kinds round-trip verified:** request, notification, result-response, error-response each serialize→buffer→read→`check-equal?`.
- [ ] **No `(module+ test …)` in `stdio.rkt` confirmed:** tests live in `test/stdio-test.rkt`.
- [ ] **S1+`json`-only imports confirmed:** require list = `json` + `../main.rkt` (no `net/*`, no `racket/system`, no subprocess/socket). (Transitive sweep is item 017.)
- [ ] **Health checks pass:** N/A (no running service).

### Expected Outcomes

Concrete, verifiable:

- The module **exports** `serialize-message`, `deserialize-message`, `make-read-buffer`, `read-buffer?`, `read-buffer-append!`, `read-buffer-read-message!`, `read-buffer-clear!`, `STDIO-DEFAULT-MAX-BUFFER-SIZE` (and NO internal helpers). `STDIO-DEFAULT-MAX-BUFFER-SIZE` = `10485760`.
- **N messages round-trip in order:** encoding N (≥3) messages, feeding the concatenated bytes, and draining yields the same N `json-object?`s in order, then `#f`.
- **Partial-frame buffering works:** a frame split across two `append!`s (including a split inside a multibyte UTF-8 codepoint) reassembles and decodes to the original message; a buffer with no newline yields `#f`.
- **Overflow raises:** appending past the (default 10 MB or a small custom) cap raises `exn:fail?` ("ReadBuffer exceeded maximum size"); exactly-at-cap does NOT raise; the buffer is cleared on the raise and is reusable afterward.
- **CRLF-framed decodes identically:** a `\r\n`-framed message `check-equal?`s its `\n`-framed decode.
- **Non-JSON line skipped, surrounding frames decode:** a non-JSON (or empty, or trailing-garbage) line between two valid frames is skipped; both valid frames still decode. A valid-JSON-but-invalid-**envelope** line **raises** (the one non-skip failure mode).
- The module **requires only S1** (+ the core `json` collection) — no subprocess/socket/`net/*` (the transitive proof, with stdio as the I/O carve-out, is item 017's collection-wide sweep).
- `raco test mcp/core/shared/` reports all checks passing, 0 failures, 0 errors; `raco test mcp/core/validators/` and `raco test mcp/core/util/` still green (M3/M4 untouched).

## Completion Reminder

On completion, **`docs/aide/progress.md` MUST be updated** (the icon discipline is forward-only — 📋 → 🚧 → ✅, never reverted):

1. Flip the **Stage S2 deliverable line** `📋 mcp/core/shared/stdio.rkt (M5e) — newline-delimited JSON framing (orphaned until S6a)` from 📋 → 🚧 (on start) → ✅ (on delivery + all acceptance criteria pass), with a one-line as-built summary mirroring the items 013–015 deliverable lines (transliteration source, key decisions, check count). Never revert an icon backward.
2. **Check the Stage-S2 acceptance box** `[ ] stdio framing (M5e) round-trips multi-message + partial-frame buffering, standalone` — **this box belongs to THIS item** (it owns the stdio-framing deliverable). Check it on delivery.
3. Do **not** check the other broad Stage-S2 acceptance boxes that depend on sibling items: the `[ ] raco test over all S2 modules passes`, `[ ] Parity rows … marked partial`, and `[ ] Demo: …` boxes belong to items 017/018. The URI-template / tool-name / schema-normalization / validator-keyword boxes are already checked (items 012–014) — leave them.
4. **Parity matrix:** this item does **NOT** flip a parity-matrix row — there is no `stdio`/`shared` row to advance in S2 (the M5e module is orphaned until S6a, and its parity is exercised with M7's `stdio.ts` row in S6a/S9). The collection-wide restricted-load sweep that *isolates* stdio is item 017. Do not touch parity rows here.
5. Leave all other S2 deliverable lines (`validators/*` ✅; `util/schema.rkt` ✅; `uri-template`/`tool-name-validation`/`metadata-utils`/`auth` ✅; tests-under-other-dirs) at their current status — this item delivers only `stdio.rkt` + its test, completing the M5 shared-util set.
